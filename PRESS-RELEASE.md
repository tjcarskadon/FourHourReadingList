##Sub-Heading:

## Summary: 
Tim Ferriss, life hacker, author, and polymath has a podcast called "The Tim Ferris Show".  In this podcast, he makes it his mission to interview top performers in many different areas.  He attempts, and often succeeds, to tease out the habits and behaviours that help make these people world class in their respective arenas.  One of the key things that nearly all of these top performers share is a passion for reading.  During each of these podcasts they often recommend reading that may help the user.  In fact, two of Tim's most common question are "What book or books do you gift?" and "If you could give ever high school or college graduate three books what would you give?".  Tim then provides links to these books in the show notes that accompany each podcast.  


##The Problem:
The show notes provide a great place to visit after listening to an episode for book recommendations.  However, if you don't want to read thru the rest of the show notes, or can't recall which books were recommended by which guest 

##The Solution:
This reading list will provide what you need in one convenient location. Searchable and sortable by attributes of the book and the guest(s) who made the recommendation.  With convenient linking to the book on Amazon. The library feature allows the user to keep track of what they have purchased and read.
